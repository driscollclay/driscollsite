					<p>Beyond criminal justice, my research interests are primarily historical in nature. My primary interest has been on the 20th Century
					and its impact on the modern day. Recently, I have been studying the rise and fall of the Roman Empire and its modern-day comparisons. 
					Basically, I'm a big supporter of the old phrase "those who do not learn history are doomed to repeat it".</p>
                    <br></br>
					<p>In my free time, I enjoy disc golfing, "regular" golfing, hiking, kayaking, and camping (more like glamping, let's be honest). 
					Basically, anything that involves being outdoors. This supports my unhealthy addiction with taking pictures of everything that I see 
					and claiming I'm a photographer. </p>
                    <br></br>
					<p class="mb-0">When I'm not outside, I'm probably playing video games or building Legos. I've also been known to <i>occasionally</i> spoil <a href='assets/img/malcolm.jpg'> my cat, Malcolm.</a></p>
